## Project Overview

This repository contains the solution to the "RPA Challenge." The RPA Challenge is designed to test the skills of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) developers by providing a scenario where a bot needs to automate the completion of a form with data extracted from various sources. The goal is to automate the task as efficiently and accurately as possible.

## Challenge Description

The RPA Challenge consists of a web form with fields that need to be populated with data. The challenge is that the fields' order changes every time the form is loaded, requiring dynamic identification and handling of the input fields.

## Features

- **Dynamic Field Handling:** Automatically detects and matches the form fields regardless of their order.
- **Data Extraction:** Extracts data from a given source (e.g., Excel, CSV).
- **Form Submission:** Automates the process of filling out and submitting the form.
